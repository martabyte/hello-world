# hello-world
Just my first repository

Hi there, you!

I'm just trying out this github thing, as I want to upload my solo projects here.

I'm a cybersecurity pentester that has recently finished university and embarked into the journey of cybersecurity, so I hope this Github represents my learning journey and improvements. I love coding and have a few projects in mind related to learning full-stack development of Web Applications. I also just discovered Unity and I'm a bit curious on how to make games, so maybe I'll upload some small projects.

See you soon!
